<h1>Exploring Honolulu's Climate</h1>

The goal for this assignment is to explore Honolulu's climate through the city's precipitation data and create a Flask API to based on the exploration queries.  This project is divided into 2 parts.

<h2>Part 1: Data exploration with Python and SQLAlchemy</h2>

The climate data is stored in a sqlite database.  Using Python and SQLAlchemy, I connected to the database and reflected the tables into classes.  To understand precipitation trends by date, I designed a query to retrieve the ast 12 months of precipitation and plotted the results in bar graph.
  


<h2>Part 2:  Create a Flask API based on the qureries</h2>

Created a restful API with flast that served the query results in dictionary formats in 4 routes.
